# Fantasy-football-project

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model for fantasy football utilizing Python. This is intended to further advance my Python analytic capabilities, as well as provide skills which are easily transferable into any field. It may also help me dominate the competition in my personal fantasy football league.

### Methods Used
* Webscraping
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Beautiful Soup
* etc. 

## Project Description
The hypothesis of this project is that there is a relationship between overall team performance statistics, environmental conditions, and individual fantasy football production. 

* Data is being pulled from two sources:

	* Fantasy Pros Official Website (https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/stats/qb.php) 
	* Fantasy Pros GitHub repository (https://github.com/fantasydatapros/data.git)
